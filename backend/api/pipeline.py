"""JAL-79: the one place an investigation actually runs.

Both POST /investigate and POST /v1/chat/completions come through here, so the trace, the
persistence and the fixture fallback cannot drift apart between them.

WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL: `investigation_trace()` was written by Lane C but nothing ever called
it, so Langfuse emitted zero spans - a scored criterion sitting at zero with the plumbing
already built. Opening the root trace here is the whole fix, and it multiplies: `run_query`
already emits a span per query that nests via OpenTelemetry context, so every SQL statement the
pipeline runs appears inside this trace automatically, with no further instrumentation.

The engine (Lane B's `build_bundle`) is still a stub. Rather than fail, we fall back to the
fixture so the API, LibreChat and the dashboard can all be wired and demoed now. That fallback
is reported honestly through `engine_status()` and GET /health - silently serving fixture
numbers as a real diagnosis is exactly the kind of thing that loses trust points.
