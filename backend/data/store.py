"""JAL-73: system of record for investigations and chat sessions.

ClickHouse is the single datastore, so completed Evidence Bundles live here rather than on
disk or in memory. Two tables, split by concern:

  bundles        — the actual evidence. Flattened columns (metric, observed/expected, primary
                    factor, localized segment, ruled-out summary) let the dashboard render a
                    card without parsing JSON; `bundle` itself is the full schema-valid
                    EvidenceBundle, the source of truth for GET /bundle/{id}.
  investigations — a lean session/tracking record (trace id, chat session, timestamps) that
                    references its evidence via `bundle_id` rather than duplicating it.

`trace_id` is persisted because POST /investigate and POST /narrate/{id} are separate HTTP
calls. Narration must attach its generation span to the trace the investigation already
opened; without the stored id it would start an orphaned second trace and the SQL steps
would look unrelated to the LLM call.

Row mapping (`_to_bundle_row` / `_bundle_from_row`) is pure and unit-tested without a database.
Reads and writes here use the raw client rather than `data.client.run_query`, because
bookkeeping should not appear as analysis spans inside an investigation trace.
