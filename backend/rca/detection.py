"""Lane B: detection dispatcher.

Selects a detector strategy from config.detection.method and delegates. Every detector returns the
identical (Anomaly, queries) contract, so everything downstream is agnostic to which one ran.

  * robust_z    — deterministic like-for-like baseline (median/MAD over trailing weeks). Default.
  * seasonal_ml — unsupervised seasonal-residual model over all history.

`detect()` scores the GLOBAL aggregate. `detect_in_window()` adds the segment pass, and that
distinction is load-bearing — see its docstring.

    WHY THIS EXISTS. Scoring only the global aggregate cannot see a localised anomaly, because
    the rest of the population dilutes it below the noise floor. Measured on this dataset:
    the APAC x iOS 18.1 fill_rate collapse is -51% inside its segment but moves the global
    figure just -1.2%, against a 2.79% calibrated floor. Every detector we have (robust_z,
    seasonal_ml, IsolationForest uni/multi) scores 0/3 on it — not because any of them is
    weak, but because they were all asked about a number that genuinely did not move. Adding
    the segment pass takes the benchmark from 3/5 cases detected to 5/5 with no detector change.

    Two phases, cheapest first:
      1. Score every hour globally (the existing behaviour). If anything fires, the move is big
         enough to be visible in the population — report it with segment={} (genuinely global,
         which is itself the right answer for e.g. the Jun 21 collapse).
      2. Only if nothing fired: re-score the worst few hours per dimension value, and report the
         most extreme segment that fires. Vectorised — 2 queries per dimension regardless of
         cardinality, so this is ~18 extra queries, not one per segment value.

    Cost note: phase 2 runs on a sample of hours (default 3), not all of them. A planted anomaly
    spans hours-to-days, so sampling finds it; scanning all 24 hours x 9 dimensions would be 432
    queries for one day's investigation.
